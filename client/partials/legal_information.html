            <p>
            The Driver agrees:
                They will have a valid insurance at the time of the trip.
That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the specified vehicle.
That they will immediately inform all Passengers of any change whatsoever to the Trip. If one or more Passengers have made a booking and the Driver decides to change any aspect of the Trip, the Driver undertakes to contact all Passengers who have made a booking in relation to that Trip and to obtain the agreement of all Passengers to the change. If a Passenger refuses the change, they are entitled to a full refund and without any compensation being paid to the Driver.
The Driver must comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.
The Driver must wait for the Passenger at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time (however, the Passenger is expected to be punctual).</p>
            
            The Passenger agrees:
That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the Driver;
That they will immediately inform the Driver or ikuun if they are required to cancel a Trip.
That they will comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.
The Passenger agrees to wait at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time for the Driver to arrive.
That they will pay the Cost Contribution to the Driver.
If the Passenger or Driver fail to comply with any of these terms or any other Conditions ikuun reserves the right to keep information relating to the breach, to publish or disclose this information on the Member’s online profile and to suspend or withdraw the Member’s access to the Site.
            
            If the Driver does make a profit, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Tripfor any other reason the Driver will be responsible for the financial consequences,losses and damages arising and ikuun will not be liable under any circumstances to the Driver or the Passenger.
            
            
            The Driver agrees and undertakes that they will take out and maintain insurance to cover the Trip and any car sharing offered or booked through the Site (including for the avoidance of doubt insurance to cover any international or overseas part of a Trip). The Driver agrees that they will, on request, provide the Passenger with evidence in advance of the Trip of the complete validity of its insurance policy. The Driver also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Driver will own or will be entitled to use the vehicle and that the vehicle will have a valid MOT certificate and the Passenger is entitled to request evidence of the Driver’s insurance, registration certificate (‘log book’), driving licence and MOT certificate at any time up to completion of the Trip.
It is ikuun’s understanding that most insurers take the view that a Passenger who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as travelling for free, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by compulsory third party insurance in the United Kingdom.However ikuun gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Driver’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.
